# Chameleon AI Agent

An adaptive AI agent that learns from interactions and modifies its own behavior to achieve goals. This project demonstrates how language models can observe, analyze, and adjust their strategies based on user interactions.

## üåü Overview

Chameleon AI Agent is an experimental platform showcasing the adaptive capabilities of modern language models. The system features an agent that:

1. Engages with users through natural conversation
2. Identifies values, preferences, and beliefs
3. Gradually adjusts its communication strategy
4. Attempts to persuade users toward specific viewpoints
5. Provides transparent logs of its adaptation process

This project serves both as a technical demonstration and an educational tool highlighting the capabilities and ethical implications of adaptive AI systems.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Self-modifying Agent**: Core AI that can update its own goals and strategies
- **Web Interface**: Interactive dashboard showing real-time agent adaptation
- **Conversation History**: Complete log of all user-agent interactions
- **Strategy Visualization**: Visual representation of how the agent's approach evolves
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side comparison with a static (non-adaptive) agent

## üß™ Experiment Ideas

- Compare how quickly the agent adapts to different user profiles
- Analyze which persuasion techniques are most effective
- Study the ethical boundaries of adaptive systems
- Explore safeguards against manipulative behavior

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Considerations

This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the potential capabilities and risks of adaptive AI systems. The ethical implications of AI persuasion and adaptation are complex, and this project aims to promote thoughtful discussion on responsible AI development.
